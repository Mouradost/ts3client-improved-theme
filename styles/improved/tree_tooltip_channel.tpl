TeamSpeak 3 Channel Tree Tooltip Template
Copyright (c) Sven 'ScP' Paulsen

The replaceable variables are embedded in "%%" like %%CLIENT_NAME%%. At this time you can 
also use %%?CLIENT_NAME%% (note the questionmark), which is a tiny "if"- query. Use it to 
remove the whole line, if a variable is empty or just "0".

Templates can be placed in "styles/" for default theme or in a sub folder named like an available 
theme (e.g. "styles/bluesky/"). Be aware that this template will not automaticly be translated when 
displayed.
